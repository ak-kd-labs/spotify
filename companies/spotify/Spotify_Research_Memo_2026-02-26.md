## Punch Line

- **Spotify is the largest audio streaming platform globally (290M premium subs, 751M total monthly active users (MAUs)) and has reached durable profitability after a decade of losses.** FY2025 operating income (OI) hit EUR2.2B on EUR17.2B rev, with operating margin (OPM) of 12.8% -- up from negative territory just two years prior.

- **The core constraint is unchanged: ~70% of every euro in revenue goes to music rights holders.** Gross margin (GM%) has expanded from 25% in FY2022 to 32% in FY2025 through price hikes, cost cuts, and content mix shift toward podcasts/audiobooks. The model projects GM% reaching 34.5% by 2030E, but this depends on label negotiations and pricing power holding.

- **The stock trades at ~62x trailing earnings and ~39x forward, pricing in continued double-digit earnings growth.** The base-case financial model implies EUR29.9B rev and EUR5.0B net income by 2030E (11.7% rev CAGR, 22.6 EUR diluted EPS). A discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis using 10% weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and 4% terminal growth yields ~EUR317/share (~$342), roughly 27% below the current price.

## What This Company Does

Spotify streams audio content -- music, podcasts, and audiobooks -- to users across mobile, desktop, smart speakers, connected cars, and web browsers. The business operates two segments:

**Premium (subscription):** Users pay a monthly fee ($11.99/month US individual plan, with family/duo/student tiers) for ad-free, on-demand listening with offline downloads. As of Q4 2025, Spotify had 290M premium subscribers. Premium rev was ~EUR15.1B in FY2025, representing ~88% of total rev. This is a highly recurring revenue stream with estimated monthly churn of ~4-5% for individual plans.

**Ad-Supported (free tier):** Users listen for free with audio/display advertisements. They have limited skip functionality and no offline access. As of Q4 2025, 461M users were on the free tier (751M total MAUs minus 290M premium). Ad-supported rev was ~EUR2.1B in FY2025, or ~12% of total rev. This segment monetizes through impressions sold to advertisers.

### The Content Library

- Over 100M music tracks, licensed from major labels, independents, and distributors
- Over 6M podcast titles, including Spotify-exclusive and owned content
- Over 300,000 audiobooks (added late 2023), with 15 hours/month included in Premium

### The Supply-Side Economics

This is what defines the business. Spotify does not own the vast majority of the music it streams. It licenses from:

1. **Three major record labels** -- Universal Music Group (UMG), Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group (WMG) -- which collectively control ~60-70% of recorded music globally and receive ~52% of Spotify's net recording-related revenue
2. **Independent labels and distributors** (Merlin, DistroKid, TuneCore)
3. **Music publishers and songwriters**, who receive a separate royalty -- currently 15.35% of US streaming revenue under the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) rate for 2023-2027

The result: **~70% of Spotify's revenue goes to rights holders.** This is the single largest determinant of profitability. Any margin expansion must come from (a) growing rev faster than royalty costs, (b) negotiating better terms, or (c) shifting content mix toward lower-cost formats. Podcasts and audiobooks carry lower royalty burdens than music -- podcast costs are typically fixed production/licensing fees or ad-revenue shares, not per-stream royalties.

### The Demand Side

Spotify acquires users through its freemium funnel: free-tier users try the platform, and a portion convert to paid. The conversion rate (premium subs / total MAUs) was 38.6% in Q4 2025, declining from 44.3% in 2021 as MAU growth in emerging markets (where free-tier usage is proportionally higher) outpaces developed markets.

Spotify's algorithmic recommendation engine -- powering Discover Weekly, Release Radar, and the AI DJ -- is widely considered a competitive moat. These features drive engagement and reduce churn by surfacing new content tailored to individual listening patterns.

### Geographic Footprint

Spotify operates in 184 markets. Revenue skews toward high-ARPU (average revenue per user) regions:

| Region | Share of MAUs | Share of Premium Subs | Share of Rev (FY2025) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Europe | ~28% | ~38% | 35% (EUR6.0B) |
| North America | ~19% | ~26% | 31% (EUR5.3B) |
| Latin America | ~21% | ~18% | 19% (EUR3.3B) |
| Rest of World | ~32% | ~18% | 15% (EUR2.6B) |

Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) -- the average monthly or annual revenue generated per subscriber -- varies substantially by region. North America and Europe generate multiples of LatAm or Rest of World ARPU, reflecting lower-priced plans in emerging markets.

## Industry & Competitive Position

Spotify holds ~31-32% of global paid music streaming subscribers, the largest share of any single platform. However, that share has gradually declined from ~34% in 2020 as YouTube Music and Amazon Music have grown faster from smaller bases.

The music streaming industry is a differentiated oligopoly (a market with few large players competing on features rather than unique content): every major service licenses the same music catalog from the same rights holders. Competition therefore occurs on user experience, algorithmic recommendations, pricing, and ecosystem integration.

### Competitor Comparison

| Platform | Paid Subs (M) | Total Users (M) | Key Advantage | Key Weakness |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Spotify** | ~290 | 751 | Algorithm, podcast/audiobook platform, freemium funnel | No hardware ecosystem; audio is entire business |
| **Apple Music** | ~115 | N/A | iPhone/Apple ecosystem lock-in; no need to be profitable standalone | No free tier; weaker recommendations |
| **Amazon Music** | ~102 | ~90 | Prime bundle; Alexa integration | UX perceived as inferior; unclear standalone value |
| **YouTube Music** | ~89 | 2.5B+ (YouTube) | Largest video/audio library; Google AI | Music UX lags; cannibalization of free YouTube |
| **Tencent Music** | ~132 | ~589 | Near-monopoly in China; social features | China-only; ARPU ~$1-2/month vs. Spotify ~EUR4.50 |

The critical competitive dynamic: Apple, Amazon, and Google can subsidize their music services as loss leaders (Apple sells hardware; Amazon sells Prime; Google sells advertising). Spotify cannot -- audio streaming is its primary business, generating ~100% of revenue.

The global music streaming market generated an estimated $62.3B in revenue in 2025. Industry forecasts project a CAGR (compound annual growth rate -- the smoothed annual growth rate over a multi-year period) of 10-12% through 2030, driven by smartphone penetration in emerging markets, continued radio-to-streaming conversion, and price increases.

## Financial Picture

### Revenue and Profit History (EUR M)

| | FY2021 | FY2022 | FY2023 | FY2024 | FY2025 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Total Rev** | 9,668 | 11,727 | 13,247 | 15,673 | 17,186 |
| Rev Growth YoY | +23% | +21% | +13% | +18% | +10% |
| **Gross Profit** | 2,591 | 2,926 | 3,447 | 4,738 | 5,496 |
| GM% | 26.8% | 25.0% | 26.0% | 30.2% | 32.0% |
| **EBITDA** | 444 | (107) | 280 | 1,715 | 2,501 |
| EBITDA Margin | 4.6% | (0.9%) | 2.1% | 10.9% | 14.6% |
| **EBIT** | 94 | (659) | (199) | 1,379 | 2,198 |
| OPM | 1.0% | (5.6%) | (1.5%) | 8.8% | 12.8% |
| **Net Income** | (34) | (430) | (532) | 1,138 | 2,212 |
| Net Margin | (0.4%) | (3.7%) | (4.0%) | 7.3% | 12.9% |

The profitability inflection was dramatic. From a EUR532M net loss in FY2023, Spotify swung to EUR1,138M net profit in FY2024 and nearly doubled to EUR2,212M in FY2025. Three factors drove this:

- **Headcount reduction:** ~17% workforce cut in December 2023 (~1,500 employees), following two prior rounds
- **Price increases:** US individual plan from $9.99 to $10.99 (mid-2023) to $11.99 (mid-2024), with $12.99+ planned for Q1 2026
- **Content cost rationalization:** Pullback from expensive exclusive podcast deals

### Segment Revenue Breakdown (EUR M)

| | FY2021 | FY2022 | FY2023 | FY2024 | FY2025 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Premium Rev** | 8,460 | 10,251 | 11,566 | 13,820 | 15,100 |
| **Ad-Supported Rev** | 1,208 | 1,476 | 1,681 | 1,853 | 2,086 |
| Ad % of Total | 12.5% | 12.6% | 12.7% | 11.8% | 12.1% |

Ad-supported revenue has stagnated as a percentage of total -- growing just 4% YoY in Q4 2025 on a constant-currency basis vs. 14% for premium. The advertising business has underperformed mgmt expectations.

### Model Projections: Base Case (EUR M)

| | 2025A | 2026E | 2027E | 2028E | 2029E | 2030E |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Premium Subs (M)** | 290 | 318 | 349 | 381 | 413 | 445 |
| **ARPU (EUR/yr)** | -- | 55.5 | 57.0 | 58.5 | 60.0 | 61.5 |
| **Premium Rev** | 15,100 | 16,872 | 19,010 | 21,352 | 23,820 | 26,384 |
| **Ad MAUs (M)** | 461 | 510 | 560 | 610 | 660 | 710 |
| **Ad Rev/MAU (EUR/yr)** | -- | 4.4 | 4.6 | 4.8 | 5.0 | 5.2 |
| **Ad Rev** | 2,086 | 2,136 | 2,461 | 2,808 | 3,175 | 3,562 |
| **Total Rev** | 17,186 | 19,008 | 21,471 | 24,160 | 26,995 | 29,946 |
| Rev Growth | +10% | +10.6% | +13.0% | +12.5% | +11.7% | +10.9% |
| **GM%** | 32.0% | 32.5% | 33.0% | 33.5% | 34.0% | 34.5% |
| **Gross Profit** | 5,496 | 6,178 | 7,085 | 8,094 | 9,178 | 10,331 |
| **EBITDA** | 2,501 | 2,989 | 3,611 | 4,311 | 5,073 | 5,892 |
| EBITDA Margin | 14.6% | 15.7% | 16.8% | 17.8% | 18.8% | 19.7% |
| **EBIT** | 2,198 | 2,699 | 3,328 | 4,035 | 4,804 | 5,630 |
| OPM | 12.8% | 14.2% | 15.5% | 16.7% | 17.8% | 18.8% |
| **Net Income** | 2,212 | 2,632 | 3,137 | 3,726 | 4,350 | 5,007 |
| **EPS Diluted (EUR)** | 10.96 | 12.30 | 14.52 | 17.09 | 19.77 | 22.55 |

Key model assumptions:

- Premium sub growth: 9% CAGR (290M to 445M by 2030)
- ARPU growth: ~3%/year (price increases partially offset by geographic mix toward lower-ARPU markets)
- Ad rev per MAU growth: ~3-4%/year (assumes programmatic ad exchange ramp)
- GM% expansion: 250 bps over 5 years (32.0% to 34.5%), driven by content mix shift and operating leverage on content costs
- OpEx discipline: R&D declines from 7.8% to 6.8% of rev; S&M from 7.2% to 6.0%; G&A from 3.3% to 2.9%
- Total rev CAGR 2025-2030: 11.7%

### Cash Flow and Balance Sheet

| | FY2023 | FY2024 | FY2025 | 2026E | 2027E | 2028E | 2029E | 2030E |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **FCF (EUR M)** | ~700 | ~2,500 | ~2,900 | 2,952 | 3,450 | 4,032 | 4,649 | 5,299 |
| FCF Margin | ~5% | ~16% | ~17% | 15.5% | 16.1% | 16.7% | 17.2% | 17.7% |

Cumulative projected free cash flow (FCF -- operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) from 2026-2030: ~EUR20.4B.

**Balance sheet (end FY2025):**
- Cash + short-term investments: EUR7.7B (EUR5.3B cash + EUR2.5B ST investments)
- Total debt: EUR1.5B (EUR1.27B exchangeable notes maturing March 2026 + lease liabilities)
- Net cash: ~EUR6.3B
- Debt/equity: ~22%
- Share buyback authorization: ~$1.5B remaining (of $2B program, expires April 2026). EUR680M in repurchases in FY2025.

The March 2026 exchangeable note maturity (EUR1.27B) is easily covered by the cash balance. Post-repayment, Spotify will be effectively debt-free.

### Operating Expense Trends

The model assumes continued OpEx leverage. Historical context:

| | FY2022 | FY2023 | FY2024 | FY2025 | 2030E |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R&D % of Rev | 11.8% | 12.1% | 9.5% | 8.1% | 6.8% |
| S&M % of Rev | 13.3% | 12.1% | 8.9% | 7.6% | 6.0% |
| G&A % of Rev | 5.4% | 3.3% | 3.0% | 3.5% | 2.9% |
| **Total OpEx %** | **30.6%** | **27.5%** | **21.4%** | **19.2%** | **15.7%** |

This is the operating leverage (OpLev) story: rev grows at ~12% while absolute OpEx grows at ~7-8%, compressing OpEx as a percentage of rev by ~350 bps over 5 years.

## Growth & Strategy

Mgmt has described 2026 as a "year of raising ambition." The key levers, cross-referenced against model assumptions:

**1. Pricing power.** Spotify plans to raise the US individual plan to $12.99+ in Q1 2026. The 2024 hike from $10.99 to $11.99 saw minimal incremental churn, emboldening further increases. The model assumes ~3% annual ARPU growth (EUR55.50 to EUR61.50 by 2030), implying continued periodic price increases partially offset by geographic mix shift.

- *Model check:* 3% ARPU growth is conservative relative to the ~9% implicit ARPU increase from $10.99 to $11.99. The model implicitly assumes slower price increases going forward and/or faster growth in low-ARPU regions.

**2. Advertising acceleration.** The Spotify Ad Exchange (SAX), launched 2024, aims to shift ad sales from direct/exclusive podcast deals to scalable programmatic (automated, auction-based) buying. Ad rev grew only 4% YoY in Q4 2025 vs. 14% for premium.

- *Model check:* The model assumes ad rev per MAU grows from EUR4.40 to EUR5.20 by 2030, a 3.4% CAGR. Ad rev grows from EUR2.1B to EUR3.6B. This is modest -- the bull case assumes 18% ad rev CAGR, which would require SAX to meaningfully scale.

**3. Content diversification.** Podcasts and audiobooks carry lower royalty burdens than music. A Premium Platinum tier (lossless audio + AI features) launched in select markets in late 2025 at higher price points, testing willingness to pay for premium features.

- *Model check:* GM% expansion from 32% to 34.5% is partially predicated on content mix shift. If podcasts/audiobooks remain a small share of total listening hours, the GM% trajectory depends more heavily on label negotiation outcomes.

**4. Emerging market growth.** India, Southeast Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa represent large addressable markets with <10% streaming penetration. The model projects total MAUs reaching 1.16B by 2030 (from 751M in 2025).

**5. AI and personalization.** AI DJ, AI-generated playlists, and search capabilities are being used to drive engagement and justify premium pricing. These features are low incremental cost and increase switching costs.

---

## Key Risks

**1. Label concentration and royalty inflation.** UMG, Sony, and WMG control ~65% of recorded music. Spotify paid Warner alone ~EUR1.16B in FY2024. The CRB increased the US songwriter statutory rate by 23% for 2023-2027. Future label negotiations could compress margins, particularly as labels observe Spotify's improving profitability and demand a larger share. In the bear case (GM% stuck at 30%), 2030E EBITDA drops to EUR2.9B vs. EUR5.9B in the base case -- a 51% haircut.

**2. Big Tech subsidization.** Apple, Amazon, and Google can run their music services at or below breakeven to support hardware, Prime, or advertising businesses. Spotify cannot subsidize losses in audio streaming with adjacent revenue streams. If competitive dynamics force slower price increases, the base-case ARPU growth of 3%/year may prove optimistic.

**3. Advertising underperformance.** Ad-supported rev has lagged premium for several years. If the ad business fails to scale (bear case: 6% CAGR), ad rev remains ~12% of total and the margin expansion story relies entirely on premium pricing and cost cuts. At a 6% ad CAGR, 2030E ad rev would be ~EUR2.8B vs. EUR3.6B in the base case.

**4. Leadership transition.** The January 2026 shift to co-CEOs (Gustav Soderstrom for product/tech, Alex Norstrom for business/commercial) is untested at this scale. Co-CEO structures have a mixed track record. Daniel Ek retains 29.1% voting power as Executive Chairman, and co-founder Martin Lorentzon holds 41.6%, so founder control remains intact.

**5. Regulatory / geopolitical.** The Trump administration has explicitly named Spotify as a potential retaliatory target if the EU does not relax Digital Markets Act (DMA) enforcement against US tech companies. Separately, Spotify's 1,000-stream minimum threshold for royalty payments (redirecting ~$40M annually) has drawn criticism from 92% of surveyed independent labels.

**6. Currency exposure.** Spotify reports in EUR but earns in 184 currencies. Q4 2025 revenue grew 13% in constant currency but only ~10% in reported EUR. Multi-hundred-million-euro FX headwinds are a recurring feature.

## Valuation Context

### Current Multiples

| Metric | SPOT | Netflix | Tencent Music | Deezer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trailing P/E | ~62x | ~45x | ~18x | N/M |
| Forward P/E | ~39x | -- | -- | -- |
| EV/Revenue | ~5.3x | ~10x | ~3x | ~1x |
| P/FCF | ~29x | -- | -- | -- |

Spotify trades at a premium to its closest listed comp (Tencent Music at 18x) and to video streaming peer Netflix (45x). No direct pure-play audio streaming peers exist at comparable scale.

### Historical Context

Spotify shares traded as low as ~$70 in late 2022 (EV/Rev ~1.5x) when the company was loss-making. The stock has rallied ~560% from that trough as the market re-rated the business for profitability. The trailing P/E has compressed from "not meaningful" to ~62x as earnings grew faster than the share price appreciated.

### What the Price Implies

At $466/share:

- MCAP = ~$96B; EV = ~$90B (subtracting ~$6B net cash)
- At 25x fwd EV/EBITDA (mature tech/media average), implied FY2026 EBITDA = $3.6B (~EUR3.3B)
- The model projects 2026E EBITDA of EUR3.0B -- implying the market is pricing in slightly faster margin expansion than the base case

### DCF Framework

Using the model's base-case projections:

| Input | Value |
|---|---|
| WACC | 10.0% (cost of equity 9.8%, cost of debt 3.5% pre-tax, 5% debt/capital) |
| Terminal growth rate | 4.0% |
| Beta | 1.15 |
| Projection period | 2026E-2030E |

| Year | UFCF (EUR M) | PV (EUR M) |
|---|---|---|
| 2026E | 2,355 | 2,141 |
| 2027E | 2,830 | 2,339 |
| 2028E | 3,386 | 2,544 |
| 2029E | 3,979 | 2,718 |
| 2030E | 4,605 | 2,859 |
| **PV of FCFs** | | **12,601** |
| **Terminal Value** | 79,820 | **49,562** |
| **Enterprise Value** | | **62,163** |
| + Net Cash (end 2025) | | 6,258 |
| **Equity Value** | | **68,421** |
| / Shares (M) | | 216 |
| **Per Share (EUR)** | | **~317** |
| **Per Share (USD @ 1.08)** | | **~342** |

The math: terminal value = EUR4,605M x (1.04) / (0.10 - 0.04) = EUR79,820M. PV of terminal = EUR79,820M / (1.10)^5 = EUR49,562M. Terminal value represents ~80% of total enterprise value, reflecting the high sensitivity to terminal growth and discount rate assumptions.

At the current price of $466, the stock trades ~36% above the DCF-implied value of ~$342. The gap closes if: (a) rev growth exceeds the 11.7% base-case CAGR, (b) margins expand faster than modeled, or (c) the market assigns a lower discount rate (lower WACC) or higher terminal growth. In the bull case (14% rev CAGR, 22% EBITDA margin by 2030), 2030E EPS reaches ~EUR28.41, which at a 30x P/E implies a stock price of ~EUR853 (~$921).

### Scenario Summary (2030E)

| | Bull | Base | Bear |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rev (EUR M) | 33,090 | 29,946 | 24,104 |
| EBITDA (EUR M) | 7,280 | 5,892 | 2,892 |
| Net Income (EUR M) | 6,307 | 5,007 | 2,426 |
| EPS Diluted (EUR) | 28.41 | 22.55 | 10.93 |
| FCF (EUR M) | 6,599 | 5,299 | 2,718 |
| Premium Subs (M) | 511 | 445 | 388 |

The range is wide: bear-case 2030E EPS of EUR10.93 vs. bull-case EUR28.41 -- a 2.6x spread driven primarily by GM% (30% vs. 38%) and revenue growth (7% vs. 14% CAGR) assumptions.
